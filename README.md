# PetStore-Swagger-API

URL - https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/user

The PetStore Swagger API provides a way to manage user accounts in a virtual pet store system. It includes features like:

Creating a user – Add a new user with details like username and password.
Updating user info – Modify user details as needed.
Retrieving user details – Get information about a specific user.
Deleting a user – Remove a user from the system.

You can test these actions using Swagger UI (a web-based tool), Postman (for API testing), or cURL (a command-line tool). It’s useful for developers learning how user management works in APIs.
